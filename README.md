# Real Estate Analysis
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the Inventory of Owned and Leased Properties (IOLP) dataset, which gives information about the real estate properties owned and leased by the federal government.

# Dataset
The dataset was sourced from the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA).

# Contents
Initial Data Exploration: Basic exploration of the dataset's features and data types.
Scatter Plot Analysis: Visual exploration of the relationship between 'Building Rentable Square Feet' and 'Available Square Feet'.
Time Series Analysis: Analysis of the construction dates of buildings and their corresponding rentable square feet over the years.
Geospatial Visualization: A map-based view showing the distribution of properties across geographic locations.
Property Distribution: Analysis of the distribution of owned vs. leased properties.

# Insights
The majority of the properties are leased rather than owned.
Rentable space shows a certain periodic trend with respect to construction dates.
The geospatial visualization provides a bird's-eye view of property distributions, giving insights into federal property concentrations.
